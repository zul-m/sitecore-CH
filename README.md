## External Components for Sitecore Content Hub

This project goes over the creation and management of External Components in Sitecoreâ€™s Content Hub, which allows you to add advanced customization in your Content Hub instance with your own reference libraries. It includes the process of creating a solution and writing external components using Vite and React JS. Then you can test from your solution and refence them internally from a portal asset in Content Hub.
